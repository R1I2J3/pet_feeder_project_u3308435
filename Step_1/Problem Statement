The shelter needs a low-cost and programmable pet feeder system that automatically dispenses set portions of dry food at set times, monitors whether the pet actually eats, and alerts staff if dispensing fails or the pet doesnâ€™t eat. The system must run unattended, log each feeding event, and send a notification (e.g. via SMS or email) when errors occur.
